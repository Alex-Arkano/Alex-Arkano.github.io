            <p class="new-text">The first semifinal of the European Football Championship ended with the victory of Italy. The Italians managed to snatch a ticket to the final in a series of penalties.</p>

            <p class="new-text">At the beginning of the match both teams decided not to sit out in defense: in the 4th minute the Italians had a chance to excel - Niccolo Barella shot into the post. The referees, however, immediately recorded the offside.</p>

            <p class="new-text">After that, the Spanish team gradually took control of the ball, but the advantage in having the initiative in dangerous attacks did not grow: until the 20th minute, the teams struck only one shot on goal.</p>

            <p class="new-text">In the middle of the first half, the Italians had a good opportunity to excel. After the goalkeeper's unsuccessful exit, Roberto Mancini's charges only had to aim at the empty net, but they were late with the shot - the defenders of the Spanish national team managed to return and block Barrella's shot.</p>

            <p class="new-text">Since then and until the break, the situation on the field has not changed much. The Italians began to press the Spaniards a little more actively in their half of the field, but the dangerous blow came only in the last minute of the first half: Italian defender Emerson was in the opponents' penalty area and from an acute angle hit the goal, but hit the crossbar.</p>

            <p class="new-text">The teams went to the break with a score of 0: 0.</p>

            <p class="new-text">At the beginning of the second half of the match, Italy and Spain began to exchange blows more often, and in the 60th minute one of the attacks ended in a goal.</p>

            <p class="new-text">The Italians caught the Spaniards on a quick counterattack - Immobile cut a pass to Insigne, he could not pass the defense, but the ball bounced to Federico Chiesi, who shot a precise shot in the far corner. The goalkeeper of the Spanish national team did not have time to react.</p>
